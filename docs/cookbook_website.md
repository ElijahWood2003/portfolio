<p>We developed a website that stores cookbook recipes and ingredients through SupabaseDB, with React for the frontend. You were able to add recipes, ingredients, and information on ingredient macros.</p>
<p>Functionality on the database has been removed since the Supabase account managing it was auto-deleted. The frontpage used to show any number of recipes to access, update, or delete.</p>
