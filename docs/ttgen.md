<p>During the winter break of 2023, I developed a project that was aimed at being able to automatically generate truth tables. I was motivated to discover the most efficient method for parsing logic statements for boolean values and variable operators.</p>
<p>To find the solution, I used a recursive function to find the "least significant evaluator" to split the left and right sides into smaller subproblems. To enhance the functionality of this method, I established a comprehensive set of rules to assist the identification of the least significant operators and associate valid </p>
