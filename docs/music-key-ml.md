<p>A ML project I am currently working on with a small group of friends. The idea is to train a machine on a large data set of music with the goal of teaching it how to fluidly find the musical key being played for live music.</p>

<p>I am building the entire software (ML), while the other collaborators are working on the hardware and UI. I am using Tensorflow for training the machine and Librosa to convert audio into spectrograms.</p>
