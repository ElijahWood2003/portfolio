# About Me

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <div>
        <p>I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with an anticipated graduation date of Fall 2025.</p> 
        <p>I possess proficiency in Javas, Python, and C, and have practical experience with HTML, CSS, Rust, and assembly languages. My specific areas of interest include software engineering, data science, and machine learning.</p>
        <p><em>Why Computer Science?</em><br>
        From Sudoku books to solving Rubix Cubes, all my life I've loved puzzles. The first time I faced the challenge of coding it felt like a natural extension of that love. Knowing every new project I work on will have a completely unique set of puzzles to solve sparks my creativity and innovation.</p>
        <p>Recently, in my projects and research, I've been directing that focus on building machine learning models. Iâ€™m excited to push the boundaries of machine learning, finding new ways to make intelligent systems more intuitive, efficient, and impactful.</p>
